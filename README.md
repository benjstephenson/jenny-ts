A small set of functions to build pseudo-random test data using a basic implementation of the State monad.
Heavily inspired by (fp-ts)[https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts], (fp-ts-generators)[https://github.com/no-day/fp-ts-generators] and [Paul Gray's post on fp-ts State monad](https://paulgray.net/the-state-monad/).
This is a side project to see how far I can get rolling my own functions to handle some FP concepts and to further my own understanding.
